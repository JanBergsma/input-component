# Input component

> **Challenge:** Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

1.  **User story:** I can see error state
2.  **User story:** I can choose to disable input
3.  **User story:** I can choose to have helper text
4.  **User story:** I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
5.  **User story:** I can have different input sizes
6.  **User story:** I can have different colors
7.  **User story:** I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
8.  **User story:** I can have multiline input like a textarea
9.  **User story:** When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
10. **User story:** I can still access all input attributes
11. **User story (optional):** Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough

# input-component

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
